```{r}
library("ggplot2")
library("knitr")
```


# 1 - Check the structure of titanic

```{r}
str(titanic_train)
```

# 2 - Bar plot to analyse the distribution of male and female across classes

```{r}
ggplot(titanic_train, aes(x = Pclass, fill = Sex)) +
  geom_bar(position = "dodge")
```

# 3 - Bar plot to analyse additional info like who survived and who did not

```{r}
ggplot(titanic_train, aes(x = Pclass, fill = Sex)) +
  geom_bar(position = "dodge") + 
    facet_grid(.~ Survived)
```

# 4 - Define an object for position jitterdodge, to use below

```{r}
posn.jd <- position_jitterdodge(0.5, 0, 0.6)
```

# 5 - Scatter plot to analyse the age of who survived and who did not across the classes

```{r}
ggplot(titanic_train, aes(x = Pclass, y =Age, color = Sex)) +
  geom_point(position = posn.jd, size = 3, alpha = 0.5) + 
    facet_grid(.~ Survived)
```
